# MonCraft
Minecraft-Like without game engine : Opengl_3.3 c++

# Development
The project is still in development, so there are still some bugs and some features are not yet implemented. To modify some parameters, you can change the values in the file "constants.cpp". To use on small devices, you can change the values in the file "globalVar.cpp" and set parameters to false. Then, to update the chunkView (distance of the chunks loaded), you can change the value in the file "include/constants.cpp".

# Compile
To compile the code, see the MakeFile to update the path of lib/include. If you have a problem with these files, check the repository of the project (RetroRoad), I suggest in FILE the same lib/include.
